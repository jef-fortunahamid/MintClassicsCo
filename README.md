# Optimising Inventory for Strategic Warehouse Closure at Mint Classics Company

*(This case study is provided by Coursera. The SQL schema file for setting up the Mint Classics database was oprovided.)*

## Business Task
The goal of this project is to explore the company's current inventory and make data-driven recommendations on how to reorganise or if possible, reduce it. The ultimate aim is to close one storage facility while exnsuring  products are still shipped to customers within 24 hours.

## Data Exploration

The SQL schema file, where we used DDL (Data Definition Language) and DML (Data Manipulation Language) file to create the database structure in MySQL workbench, was provided.

Looking at our ER Diagram, there are nine tables in our database. Now, let's explore our `mintclassics` database.

Before we start, on MySQL workbench we need to run the following query:
```sql
USE mintclassics;
```
We need to run this code, if you have more than one database installed on your MySQL workbench (like mine, there are four other databases installed). So we don't have to keep referring the `mintclassics` database on our FROM clause.

#### Getting Familiar with Data

Let's look at the table with atmost important, the `warehouses` table.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM warehouses;
```

Looking at the table, there are four warehouses, where the `warehouseCode` and `warehouseName` are provided for each. The third column is `warehousePctCap`, which we can assume it is the 'Percentage Capacity' of each warehouse. Warehouse c (West) has the lowest percentage capacity, where the least number of stocks where we can relocate to the other warehouses. Warehouses a (North), b (East) and d (South) have percent capacity of 72, 67 and 75 percent, respectively. A total of 85 percent free space from all three warehouses.

Unfortunately, we don't have the exact location of each warehouse. We can include this to our 'Reccommendation for Further Study'.

Now, we proceed to explore more of the tables of interest.

*products Table*
```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
LIMIT 10;
```

#### Find Out Where Items are Stored
With this table, the inventory of our stocks is provided on this table.
```sql
SELECT
      DISTINCT(productCode)
    , productName
FROM products;
```

There are 110 products on our list.

With this information, we need to know if the same products are stored in one or more than one warehouse. So we need to look for the products with the same `productName` but different `warehouseCode` using the following query:
```sql
SELECT
      productCode
    , COUNT(warehouseCode) AS number_of_warehouse
FROM products
GROUP BY 
    productCode
HAVING 
    COUNT(warehouseCode) > 1;
```

There is zero or no row/s or value/s returned with this query. We can say, each warehouse stores unique items.

We can run the following query to know products beinf stored on each warehouse:
```sql
SELECT
      warehouseCode
    , productCode
    , quantityInStock
FROM products
WHERE
    warehouseCode = 'a';
```
